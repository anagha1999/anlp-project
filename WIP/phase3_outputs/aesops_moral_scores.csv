1,THE FOX AND THE GRAPES,"A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, ""I thought those Grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour.""",,0.22650012,0.2532062,0.2311595,0.29803488,0.27040535,0.26345363,0.24561603,0.26674008,0.26966506,0.34530243,sanctity.vice,0.34530243
2,THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS,"A Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid a Golden Egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once. But when they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose. Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth",Much wants more and loses all.,0.2515609,0.20068084,0.22745888,0.26165146,0.26628795,0.222719,0.24558738,0.18837012,0.26133177,0.30130535,sanctity.vice,0.30130535
3,THE CAT AND THE MICE,"There was once a house that was overrun with Mice. A Cat heard of this, and said to herself, ""That's the place for me,"" and off she went and took up her quarters in the house, and caught the Mice one by one and ate them. At last the Mice could stand it no longer, and they determined to take to their holes and stay there. ""That's awkward,"" said the Cat to herself: ""the only thing to do is to coax them out by a trick."" So she considered a while, and then climbed up the wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and pretended to be dead. By and by a Mouse peeped out and saw the Cat hanging there. ""Aha!"" it cried, ""you're very clever, madam, no doubt: but you may turn yourself into a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you won't catch us coming anywhere near you.""

4,THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG,"There was once a Dog who used to snap at people and bite them without any provocation, and who was a great nuisance to every one who came to his master's house. So his master fastened a bell round his neck to warn people of his presence. The Dog was very proud of the bell, and strutted about tinkling it with immense satisfaction. But an old dog came up to him and said, ""The fewer airs you give yourself the better, my friend. You don't think, do you, that your bell was given you as a reward of merit? On the contrary, it is a badge of disgrace.""

5,THE CHARCOAL-BURNER AND THE FULLER,"There was once a Charcoal-burner who lived and worked by himself. A Fuller, however, happened to come and settle in the same neighbourhood; and the Charcoal-burner, having made his acquaintance and finding he was an agreeable sort of fellow, asked him if he would come and share his house: ""We shall get to know one another better that way,"" he said, ""and, beside, our household expenses will be diminished."" The Fuller thanked him, but replied, ""I couldn't think of it, sir: why, everything I take such pains to whiten would be blackened in no time by your charcoal.""",,0.41812557,0.33664685,0.40072748,0.35421613,0.4365912,0.33159053,0.41064435,0.32178375,0.4083569,0.3780039,loyalty.virtue,0.4365912
6,THE MICE IN COUNCIL,"Once upon a time all the Mice met together in Council, and discussed the best means of securing themselves against the attacks of the cat. After several suggestions had been debated, a Mouse of some standing and experience got up and said, ""I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry it out. It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy the cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her approach."" This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already decided to adopt it, when an old Mouse got upon his feet and said, ""I agree with you all that the plan before us is an admirable one: but may I ask who is going to bell the cat?""",,0.38380685,0.31460536,0.3494866,0.3103999,0.44392926,0.32645735,0.40252104,0.28953165,0.38939112,0.35004324,loyalty.virtue,0.44392926
7,THE BAT AND THE WEASELS,"A Bat fell to the ground and was caught by a Weasel, and was just going to be killed and eaten when it begged to be let go. The Weasel said he couldn't do that because he was an enemy of all birds on principle. ""Oh, but,"" said the Bat, ""I'm not a bird at all: I'm a mouse."" ""So you are,"" said the Weasel, ""now I come to look at you""; and he let it go. Some time after this the Bat was caught in just the same way by another Weasel, and, as before, begged for its life. ""No,"" said the Weasel, ""I never let a mouse go by any chance."" ""But I'm not a mouse,"" said the Bat; ""I'm a bird."" ""Why, so you are,"" said the Weasel; and he too let the Bat go.

9,THE FOX AND THE CROW,"A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, ""What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."" The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, ""You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits.""",,0.29006806,0.24914603,0.26962128,0.28586507,0.29761443,0.25390306,0.34159207,0.24516104,0.3479353,0.33631006,sanctity.virtue,0.3479353

11,THE WOLF AND THE LAMB,"A Wolf came upon a Lamb straying from the flock, and felt some compunction about taking the life of so helpless a creature without some plausible excuse; so he cast about for a grievance and said at last, ""Last year, sirrah, you grossly insulted me."" ""That is impossible, sir,"" bleated the Lamb, ""for I wasn't born then."" ""Well,"" retorted the Wolf, ""you feed in my pastures."" ""That cannot be,"" replied the Lamb, ""for I have never yet tasted grass."" ""You drink from my spring, then,"" continued the Wolf. ""Indeed, sir,"" said the poor Lamb, ""I have never yet drunk anything but my mother's milk.""

15,THE OLD WOMAN AND THE DOCTOR,"An Old Woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and, after consulting a Doctor, made an agreement with him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee if he cured her, while if he failed he was to receive nothing. The Doctor accordingly prescribed a course of treatment, and every time he paid her a visit he took away with him some article out of the house, until at last, when he visited her for the last time, and the cure was complete, there was nothing left. When the Old Woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him his fee; and, after repeated refusals on her part, he sued her before the magistrates for payment of her debt. On being brought into court she was ready with her defence. ""The claimant,"" said she, ""has stated the facts about our agreement correctly. I undertook to pay him a fee if he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he failed. Now, he says I am cured; but I say that I am blinder than ever, and I can prove what I say.

17,MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN,"A Woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river, when his axe, glancing off the trunk, flew out of his hands and fell into the water. As he stood by the water's edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared and asked him the reason for his grief; and on learning what had happened, out of pity for his distress he dived into the river and, bringing up a golden axe, asked him if that was the one he had lost. The Woodman replied that it was not, and Mercury then dived a second time, and, bringing up a silver axe, asked if that was his. ""No, that is not mine either,"" said the Woodman. Once more Mercury dived into the river, and brought up the missing axe. The Woodman was overjoyed at recovering his property, and thanked his benefactor warmly; and the latter was so pleased with his honesty that he made him a present of the other two axes. When the Woodman told the story to his companions, one of these was filled with envy of his good fortune and determined to try his luck for himself. So he went and began to fell a tree at the edge of the river, and presently contrived to let his axe drop into the water. Mercury appeared as before, and, on learning that his axe had fallen in, he dived and brought up a golden axe, as he had done on the previous occasion. Without waiting to be asked whether it was his or not the fellow cried, ""That's mine, that's mine,"" and stretched out his hand eagerly for the prize: but Mercury was so disgusted at his dishonesty that he not only declined to give him the golden axe, but also refused to recover for him the one he had let fall into the stream.

18,"THE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION","An Ass and a Fox went into partnership and sallied out to forage for food together. They hadn't gone far before they saw a Lion coming their way, at which they were both dreadfully frightened. But the Fox thought he saw a way of saving his own skin, and went boldly up to the Lion and whispered in his ear, ""I'll manage that you shall get hold of the Ass without the trouble of stalking him, if you'll promise to let me go free."" The Lion agreed to this, and the Fox then rejoined his companion and contrived before long to lead him by a hidden pit, which some hunter had dug as a trap for wild animals, and into which he fell. When the Lion saw that the Ass was safely caught and couldn't get away, it was to the Fox that he first turned his attention, and he soon finished him off, and then at his leisure proceeded to feast upon the Ass","Betray a friend, and you'll often find you have ruined yourself.",0.38106298,0.2972865,0.32398593,0.3094463,0.40462115,0.32686532,0.35362655,0.25889543,0.31490847,0.31725466,loyalty.virtue,0.40462115

The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion.""",,0.40835285,0.35682932,0.3293278,0.3114136,0.33568004,0.33811545,0.36850446,0.30011046,0.38384002,0.35839033,care.virtue,0.40835285

22,THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN,"A dispute arose between the North Wind and the Sun, each claiming that he was stronger than the other. At last they agreed to try their powers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest strip him of his cloak. The North Wind had the first try; and, gathering up all his force for the attack, he came whirling furiously down upon the man, and caught up his cloak as though he would wrest it from him by one single effort: but the harder he blew, the more closely the man wrapped it round himself. Then came the turn of the Sun. At first he beamed gently upon the traveller, who soon unclasped his cloak and walked on with it hanging loosely about his shoulders: then he shone forth in his full strength, and the man, before he had gone many steps, was glad to throw his cloak right off and complete his journey more lightly clad",Persuasion is better than force,0.33701816,0.36187115,0.38287178,0.35786855,0.42964822,0.36648467,0.43656918,0.37591213,0.39400584,0.34262544,authority.virtue,0.43656918

They were not allowed to lie long abed in the mornings, but the old lady had them up and doing as soon as the cock crew. They disliked intensely having to get up at such an hour, especially in winter-time: and they thought that if it were not for the cock waking up their Mistress so horribly early, they could sleep longer. So they caught it and wrung its neck. But they weren't prepared for the consequences.

24,THE GOODS AND THE ILLS,"There was a time in the youth of the world when Goods and Ills entered equally into the concerns of men, so that the Goods did not prevail to make them altogether blessed, nor the Ills to make them wholly miserable. But owing to the foolishness of mankind the Ills multiplied greatly in number and increased in strength, until it seemed as though they would deprive the Goods of all share in human affairs, and banish them from the earth. The latter, therefore, betook themselves to heaven and complained to Jupiter of the treatment they had received, at the same time praying him to grant them protection from the Ills, and to advise them concerning the manner of their intercourse with men. Jupiter granted their request for protection, and decreed that for the future they should not go among men openly in a body, and so be liable to attack from the hostile Ills, but singly and unobserved, and at infrequent and unexpected intervals. Hence it is that the earth is full of Ills, for they come and go as they please and are never far away; while Goods, alas! come one by one only, and have to travel all the way from heaven, so that they are very seldom seen.",,0.41334003,0.38354892,0.38751522,0.34034374,0.43138513,0.35500005,0.3832739,0.36661956,0.38721734,0.3546636,loyalty.virtue,0.43138513
25,THE HARES AND THE FROGS,"The Hares once gathered together and lamented the unhappiness of their lot, exposed as they were to dangers on all sides and lacking the strength and the courage to hold their own. Men, dogs, birds and beasts of prey were all their enemies, and killed and devoured them daily: and sooner than endure such persecution any longer, they one and all determined to end their miserable lives. Thus resolved and desperate, they rushed in a body towards a neighbouring pool, intending to drown themselves. On the bank were sitting a number of Frogs, who, when they heard the noise of the Hares as they ran, with one accord leaped into the water and hid themselves in the depths. Then one of the older Hares who was wiser than the rest cried out to his companions, ""Stop, my friends, take heart; don't let us destroy ourselves after all: see, here are creatures who are afraid of us, and who must, therefore, be still more timid than ourselves.""",,0.41533864,0.42590806,0.37056056,0.32288665,0.46559954,0.376578,0.40726864,0.34872562,0.37995195,0.36092627,loyalty.virtue,0.46559954

The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth. Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement. But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease. Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.",,0.2088312,0.20494072,0.19464037,0.257309,0.23164025,0.21776745,0.21725346,0.2034354,0.20853831,0.3024282,sanctity.vice,0.3024282

He completely deceived the shepherd, and when the flock was penned for the night he was shut in with the rest.

Presently one of the Oxen said to him, ""What has induced you to come in here? Aren't you aware of the risk you are running of being captured by the herdsmen?"" To which he replied, ""Pray let me stay for the present. When night comes I shall easily escape under cover of the dark."" In the course of the afternoon more than one of the farm-hands came in, to attend to the wants of the cattle, but not one of them noticed the presence of the Stag, who accordingly began to congratulate himself on his escape and to express his gratitude to the Oxen. ""We wish you well,"" said the one who had spoken before, ""but you are not out of danger yet. If the master comes, you will certainly be found out, for nothing ever escapes his keen eyes."" Presently, sure enough, in he came, and made a great to-do about the way the Oxen were kept. ""The beasts are starving,"" he cried; ""here, give them more hay, and put plenty of litter under them."" As he spoke, he seized an armful himself from the pile where the Stag lay concealed, and at once detected him. Calling his men, he had him seized at once and killed for the table.",,0.37651885,0.32279524,0.2978547,0.2895,0.34764296,0.32695267,0.37662718,0.25560525,0.35045248,0.3211817,authority.virtue,0.37662718
29,THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL,"A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning to the dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head. As she walked along, she fell a-musing after this fashion: ""The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I will make into butter and take to market to sell. With the money I will buy a number of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by and by I shall have quite a large poultry-yard. Then I shall sell some of my fowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a new gown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair; and all the young fellows will admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head and have nothing to say to them."" Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, she tossed her head. Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and all her fine castles in the air vanished in a moment!

31,THE FOX AND THE MONKEY,"A Fox and a Monkey were on the road together, and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born. They kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when the Monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh. ""Why do you sigh?"" said the Fox. The Monkey pointed to the tombs and replied, ""All the monuments that you see here were put up in honour of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men.""

32,THE ASS AND THE LAP-DOG,"There was once a man who had an Ass and a Lap-dog. The Ass was housed in the stable with plenty of oats and hay to eat and was as well off as an ass could be. The little Dog was made a great pet of by his master, who fondled him and often let him lie in his lap; and if he went out to dinner, he would bring back a tit-bit or two to give him when he ran to meet him on his return. The Ass had, it is true, a good deal of work to do, carting or grinding the corn, or carrying the burdens of the farm: and ere long he became very jealous, contrasting his own life of labour with the ease and idleness of the Lap-dog. At last one day he broke his halter, and frisking into the house just as his master sat down to dinner, he pranced and capered about, mimicking the frolics of the little favourite, upsetting the table and smashing the crockery with his clumsy efforts. Not content with that, he even tried to jump on his master's lap, as he had so often seen the dog allowed to do. At that the servants, seeing the danger their master was in, belaboured the silly Ass with sticks and cudgels, and drove him back to his stable half dead with his beating. ""Alas!"" he cried, ""all this I have brought on myself. Why could I not be satisfied with my natural and honourable position, without wishing to imitate the ridiculous antics of that useless little Lap-dog?""",,0.22044943,0.2286771,0.18702264,0.26219168,0.23497483,0.2545584,0.27712852,0.24180879,0.2212168,0.28682587,sanctity.vice,0.28682587

At nightfall the Cock flew up into the branches of a tree to roost, while the Dog curled himself up inside the trunk, which was hollow. At break of day the Cock woke up and crew, as usual. A Fox heard, and, wishing to make a breakfast of him, came and stood under the tree and begged him to come down. ""I should so like,"" said he, ""to make the acquaintance of one who has such a beautiful voice."" The Cock replied, ""Would you just wake my porter who sleeps at the foot of the tree? He'll open the door and let you in.""

37,THE BEAR AND THE TRAVELLERS,"Two Travellers were on the road together, when a Bear suddenly appeared on the scene. Before he observed them, one made for a tree at the side of the road, and climbed up into the branches and hid there. The other was not so nimble as his companion; and, as he could not escape, he threw himself on the ground and pretended to be dead. The Bear came up and sniffed all round him, but he kept perfectly still and held his breath: for they say that a bear will not touch a dead body. The Bear took him for a corpse, and went away. When the coast was clear, the Traveller in the tree came down, and asked the other what it was the Bear had whispered to him when he put his mouth to his ear. The other replied, ""He told me never again to travel with a friend who deserts you at the first sign of danger.""

38,THE SLAVE AND THE LION,"A Slave ran away from his master, by whom he had been most cruelly treated, and, in order to avoid capture, betook himself into the desert. As he wandered about in search of food and shelter, he came to a cave, which he entered and found to be unoccupied. Really, however, it was a Lion's den, and almost immediately, to the horror of the wretched fugitive, the Lion himself appeared. The man gave himself up for lost: but, to his utter astonishment, the Lion, instead of springing upon him and devouring him, came and fawned upon him, at the same time whining and lifting up his paw. Observing it to be much swollen and inflamed, he examined it and found a large thorn embedded in the ball of the foot. He accordingly removed it and dressed the wound as well as he could: and in course of time it healed up completely. The Lion's gratitude was unbounded; he looked upon the man as his friend, and they shared the cave for some time together. A day came, however, when the Slave began to long for the society of his fellow-men, and he bade farewell to the Lion and returned to the town. Here he was presently recognised and carried off in chains to his former master, who resolved to make an example of him, and ordered that he should be thrown to the beasts at the next public spectacle in the theatre. On the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena, and among the rest a Lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect; and then the wretched Slave was cast in among them. What was the amazement of the spectators, when the Lion after one glance bounded up to him and lay down at his feet with every expression of affection and delight! It was his old friend of the cave! The audience clamoured that the Slave's life should be spared: and the governor of the town, marvelling at such gratitude and fidelity in a beast, decreed that both should receive their liberty.",,0.35169044,0.24448271,0.25205103,0.2219745,0.28975594,0.2992416,0.30546728,0.22367714,0.28683493,0.26292545,care.virtue,0.35169044

The Flea, terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice, ""Oh, sir! pray let me go; don't kill me! I am such a little thing that I can't do you much harm.""

She said she would be very grateful if he would give stings to the bees, to kill people who robbed them of their honey. Jupiter was greatly displeased with this request, for he loved mankind: but he had given his word, so he said that stings they should have.

When the Travellers came into his presence he asked them what they thought of him as a King. The lying Traveller said, ""Sire, every one must see that you are a most noble and mighty monarch."" ""And what do you think of my subjects?"" continued the King. ""They,"" said the Traveller, ""are in every way worthy of their royal master."" The Ape was so delighted with his answer that he gave him a very handsome present. The other Traveller thought that if his companion was rewarded so splendidly for telling a lie, he himself would certainly receive a still greater reward for telling the truth; so, when the Ape turned to him and said, ""And what, sir, is your opinion?"" he replied, ""I think you are a very fine Ape, and all your subjects are fine Apes too.""

On the way home the Ass stumbled as he was crossing a stream and fell into the water. The salt got thoroughly wetted and much of it melted and drained away, so that, when he got on his legs again, the Ass found his load had become much less heavy. His master, however, drove him back to town and bought more salt, which he added to what remained in the panniers, and started out again. No sooner had they reached a stream than the Ass lay down in it, and rose, as before, with a much lighter load. But his master detected the trick, and turning back once more, bought a large number of sponges, and piled them on the back of the Ass. When they came to the stream the Ass again lay down: but this time, as the sponges soaked up large quantities of water, he found, when he got up on his legs, that he had a bigger burden to carry than ever",You may play a good card once too often.,0.20974095,0.15272138,0.15909868,0.19673023,0.18908396,0.18210463,0.21319944,0.19404571,0.19599979,0.249699,sanctity.vice,0.249699

He did this more than once, and every time the villagers found they had been hoaxed, for there was no Wolf at all. At last a Wolf really did come, and the Boy cried, ""Wolf! wolf!"" as loud as he could: but the people were so used to hearing him call that they took no notice of his cries for help.

The Goat thought of nothing but the prospect of quenching his thirst, and jumped in at once. When he had had enough to drink, he looked about, like the Fox, for some way of getting out, but could find none. Presently the Fox said, ""I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs, and plant your forelegs firmly against the side of the well, and then I'll climb on to your back, and, from there, by stepping on your horns, I can get out. And when I'm out, I'll help you out too."" The Goat did as he was requested, and the Fox climbed on to his back and so out of the well; and then he coolly walked away. The Goat called loudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out: but the Fox merely turned and said, ""If you had as much sense in your head as you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well without making certain that you could get out again.""

As soon as their father was dead, the Sons took spade and fork and turned up the soil of the vineyard over and over again, in their search for the treasure which they supposed to lie buried there","They found none, however: but the vines, after so thorough a digging, produced a crop such as had never before been seen.",0.30360565,0.3227408,0.295938,0.304604,0.3692457,0.33105028,0.3210976,0.27354828,0.3470386,0.33255833,loyalty.virtue,0.3692457
53,THE DOG AND THE COOK,"A rich man once invited a number of his friends and acquaintances to a banquet. His dog thought it would be a good opportunity to invite another Dog, a friend of his; so he went to him and said, ""My master is giving a feast: there'll be a fine spread, so come and dine with me to-night."" The Dog thus invited came, and when he saw the preparations being made in the kitchen he said to himself, ""My word, I'm in luck: I'll take care to eat enough to-night to last me two or three days."" At the same time he wagged his tail briskly, by way of showing his friend how delighted he was to have been asked. But just then the Cook caught sight of him, and, in his annoyance at seeing a strange Dog in the kitchen, caught him up by the hind legs and threw him out of the window. He had a nasty fall, and limped away as quickly as he could, howling dismally. Presently some other dogs met him, and said, ""Well, what sort of a dinner did you get?"" To which he replied, ""I had a splendid time: the wine was so good, and I drank so much of it, that I really don't remember how I got out of the house!""

54,THE MONKEY AS KING,"At a gathering of all the animals the Monkey danced and delighted them so much that they made him their King. The Fox, however, was very much disgusted at the promotion of the Monkey: so having one day found a trap with a piece of meat in it, he took the Monkey there and said to him, ""Here is a dainty morsel I have found, sire; I did not take it myself, because I thought it ought to be reserved for you, our King. Will you be pleased to accept it?"" The Monkey made at once for the meat and got caught in the trap. Then he bitterly reproached the Fox for leading him into danger; but the Fox only laughed and said, ""O Monkey, you call yourself King of the Beasts and haven't more sense than to be taken in like that!""",,0.23612224,0.2567225,0.21488284,0.25191924,0.292054,0.23407917,0.32217446,0.2089831,0.27575746,0.28653714,authority.virtue,0.32217446

Fortune was displeased at this, and came to him and said, ""My man, why do you give Earth the credit for the gift which I bestowed upon you?

So he determined to convince them of their folly by the following means. Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited each in turn to break it across his knee. All tried and all failed: and then he undid the bundle, and handed them the sticks one by one, when they had no difficulty at all in breaking them.

If you take my advice, you will destroy it now when it is small: for when it grows big, the mistletoe will appear upon it, from which birdlime will be prepared for your destruction."" Again, when the first flax was sown, she said to them, ""Go and eat up that seed, for it is the seed of the flax, out of which men will one day make nets to catch you."" Once more, when she saw the first archer, she warned the Birds that he was their deadly enemy, who would wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them. But they took no notice of what she said: in fact, they thought she was rather mad, and laughed at her. When, however, everything turned out as she had foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect for her wisdom. Hence, whenever she appears, the Birds attend upon her in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good. She, however, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on the folly of her kind.",,0.28771913,0.24257945,0.26901707,0.24337167,0.30076018,0.24814267,0.33529472,0.26565987,0.33417267,0.27391386,authority.virtue,0.33529472

Then he went about frightening every one he met, for they all took him to be a lion, men and beasts alike, and took to their heels when they saw him coming. Elated by the success of his trick, he loudly brayed in triumph. The Fox heard him, and recognised him at once for the Ass he was, and said to him, ""Oho, my friend, it's you, is it?

63,THE OLD LION,"A Lion, enfeebled by age and no longer able to procure food for himself by force, determined to do so by cunning. Betaking himself to a cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick: and whenever any of the other animals entered to inquire after his health, he sprang upon them and devoured them. Many lost their lives in this way, till one day a Fox called at the cave, and, having a suspicion of the truth, addressed the Lion from outside instead of going in, and asked him how he did. He replied that he was in a very bad way: ""But,"" said he, ""why do you stand outside? Pray come in.""

Another Fox, happening to pass that way, came and asked him what the matter was; and, on learning the state of the case, said, ""Well, my friend, I see nothing for it but for you to stay where you are till you shrink to your former size; you'll get out then easily enough.""",,0.24660403,0.24297683,0.2474207,0.23818906,0.24733813,0.23946191,0.22505555,0.22517964,0.25382444,0.2930569,sanctity.vice,0.2930569

In order that they might never be separated, the Frog tied himself and the Mouse together by the leg with a piece of thread. As long as they kept on dry land all went fairly well; but, coming to the edge of a pool, the Frog jumped in, taking the Mouse with him, and began swimming about and croaking with pleasure. The unhappy Mouse, however, was soon drowned, and floated about on the surface in the wake of the Frog. There he was spied by a Hawk, who pounced down on him and seized him in his talons.

Disappointed at its barrenness he determined to cut it down, and went and fetched his axe for the purpose. But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers saw what he was about to do, they begged him to spare it, and said to him, ""If you destroy the tree we shall have to seek shelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping to enliven your work in the garden."" He, however, refused to listen to them, and set to work with a will to cut through the trunk. A few strokes showed that it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees and a large store of honey.

But one day he was unwise enough to start chattering, when they at once saw through his disguise and pecked him so unmercifully that he was glad to escape and join his own kind again.

The Frogs were terrified at first by the splash, and scuttled away into the deepest parts of the pool; but by and by, when they saw that the log remained motionless, one by one they ventured to the surface again, and before long, growing bolder, they began to feel such contempt for it that they even took to sitting upon it. Thinking that a King of that sort was an insult to their dignity, they sent to Jupiter a second time, and begged him to take away the sluggish King he had given them, and to give them another and a better one.

The Eagle protested that it was idle for him to try, as nature had not provided him with wings; but the Tortoise pressed him with entreaties and promises of treasure, insisting that it could only be a question of learning the craft of the air. So at length the Eagle consented to do the best he could for him, and picked him up in his talons.

83,THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL,"A fox once fell into a trap, and after a struggle managed to get free, but with the loss of his brush. He was then so much ashamed of his appearance that he thought life was not worth living unless he could persuade the other Foxes to part with their tails also, and thus divert attention from his own loss. So he called a meeting of all the Foxes, and advised them to cut off their tails: ""They're ugly things anyhow,"" he said, ""and besides they're heavy, and it's tiresome to be always carrying them about with you.""

Wishing to look their best on the occasion they repaired to the banks of a stream, where they busied themselves in washing and preening their feathers. The Jackdaw was there along with the rest, and realised that, with his ugly plumage, he would have no chance of being chosen as he was: so he waited till they were all gone, and then picked up the most gaudy of the feathers they had dropped, and fastened them about his own body, with the result that he looked gayer than any of them.

The Sea arose in the form of a woman, and replied, ""Lay not the blame on me, O sailor, but on the Winds.

As soon as he had recovered the use of them, the Eagle flew out and caught a hare, which he brought home and presented to his benefactor.

While he stood there looking at himself, he was seen and attacked by a Lion; but in the chase which ensued, he soon drew away from his pursuer, and kept his lead as long as the ground over which he ran was open and free of trees. But coming presently to a wood, he was caught by his antlers in the branches, and fell a victim to the teeth and claws of his enemy.

Acting on his advice, they chose the biggest Mice to be their leaders, and these, in order to be distinguished from the rank and file, provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes of straw. They then led out the Mice to battle, confident of victory: but they were defeated as usual, and were soon scampering as fast as they could to their holes.

The goddess tried to console him by saying, ""You have not, it is true, the power of song, but then you far excel all the rest in beauty: your neck flashes like the emerald and your splendid tail is a marvel of gorgeous colour."" But the Peacock was not appeased. ""What is the use,"" said he, ""of being beautiful, with a voice like mine?"" Then Juno replied, with a shade of sternness in her tones, ""Fate has allotted to all their destined gifts: to yourself beauty, to the eagle strength, to the nightingale song, and so on to all the rest in their degree; but you alone are dissatisfied with your portion.

But when the war was over he employed him on all sorts of drudgery, bestowing but little attention upon him, and giving him, moreover, nothing but chaff to eat. The time came when war broke out again, and the Soldier saddled and bridled his Horse, and, having put on his heavy coat of mail, mounted him to ride off and take the field. But the poor half-starved beast sank down under his weight, and said to his rider, ""You will have to go into battle on foot this time.

The latter seized the beast by the ear, but his teeth were gone and he could not retain his hold; so the boar escaped.

The announcement attracted a crowd of conjurers, jugglers, and acrobats, and among the rest a Clown, very popular with the crowd, who let it be known that he was going to give an entirely new turn. When the day of the performance came, the theatre was filled from top to bottom some time before the entertainment began. Several performers exhibited their tricks, and then the popular favourite came on empty-handed and alone. At once there was a hush of expectation: and he, letting his head fall upon his breast, imitated the squeak of a pig to such perfection that the audience insisted on his producing the animal, which, they said, he must have somewhere concealed about his person. He, however, convinced them that there was no pig there, and then the applause was deafening. Among the spectators was a Countryman, who disparaged the Clown's performance and announced that he would give a much superior exhibition of the same trick on the following day. Again the theatre was filled to overflowing, and again the Clown gave his imitation amidst the cheers of the crowd. The Countryman, meanwhile, before going on the stage, had secreted a young porker under his smock; and when the spectators derisively bade him do better if he could, he gave it a pinch in the ear and made it squeal loudly. But they all with one voice shouted out that the Clown's imitation was much more true to life. Thereupon he produced the pig from under his smock and said sarcastically, ""There, that shows what sort of judges you are!""",,0.3151183,0.36937436,0.38002262,0.38298726,0.40955222,0.39150187,0.42715248,0.38199577,0.4020309,0.43218073,sanctity.vice,0.43218073

One of the young Larks overheard him, and was very much frightened, and asked her mother whether they hadn't better move house at once. ""There's no hurry,"" replied she; ""a man who looks to his friends for help will take his time about a thing."" In a few days the Farmer came by again, and saw that the grain was overripe and falling out of the ears upon the ground. ""I must put it off no longer,"" he said; ""This very day I'll hire the men and set them to work at once.""

Having thus driven the Eagle almost out of her senses with terror, the Cat climbed down the tree, and said to the Sow, ""I must warn you against that dreadful bird, the Eagle. She is only waiting her chance to fly down and carry off one of your little pigs when you take them out, to feed her brood with."" She succeeded in frightening the Sow as much as the Eagle. Then she returned to her hole in the trunk, from which, feigning to be afraid, she never came forth by day. Only by night did she creep out unseen to procure food for her kittens.

In the heat of the chase the Dolphin followed him, and there they both lay out of the water, gasping for dear life.

A Carpenter got up and advised the use of wood, which he said was readily procurable and easily worked.

The Bull charged furiously into the wall again and again until he was tired out, and sank down on the ground exhausted with his efforts. When all was quiet, the Mouse darted out and bit him again. Beside himself with rage he started to his feet, but by that time the Mouse was back in his hole again, and he could do nothing but bellow and fume in helpless anger.

141,THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE,"A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were acquaintances, and the Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came, and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots, the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour. The fare was not much to the taste of the guest, and presently he broke out with ""My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me, and I promise you you shall live on the fat of the land."" So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him, and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates. The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it, and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided: but before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again; but some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. ""Good-bye,"" said he, ""I'm off.

142,THE LION AND THE BULL,"A Lion saw a fine fat Bull pasturing among a herd of cattle and cast about for some means of getting him into his clutches; so he sent him word that he was sacrificing a sheep, and asked if he would do him the honour of dining with him. The Bull accepted the invitation, but, on arriving at the Lion's den, he saw a great array of saucepans and spits, but no sign of a sheep; so he turned on his heel and walked quietly away. The Lion called after him in an injured tone to ask the reason, and the Bull turned round and said, ""I have reason enough.

Unfortunately, the string was still on his leg, and before long it got entangled in the branches of a tree and the Jackdaw couldn't get free, try as he would.

She begged him repeatedly to have some consideration for her comfort, but the Grasshopper, if anything, only chirped the louder. At last the Owl could stand it no longer, but determined to rid herself of the pest by means of a trick. Addressing herself to the Grasshopper, she said in her pleasantest manner, ""As I cannot sleep for your song, which, believe me, is as sweet as the notes of Apollo's lyre, I have a mind to taste some nectar, which Minerva gave me the other day. Won't you come in and join me?"" The Grasshopper was flattered by the praise of his song, and his mouth, too, watered at the mention of the delicious drink, so he said he would be delighted.

He gave out that he had the secret of a universal antidote against all poisons, and acquired no small reputation, thanks to his talent for puffing himself. One day, however, he fell very ill; and the King of the country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy. Calling, therefore, for a cup, he poured out a dose of the antidote, and, under pretence of mixing poison with it, added a little water, and commanded him to drink it. Terrified by the fear of being poisoned, the Cobbler confessed that he knew nothing about medicine, and that his antidote was worthless. Then the King summoned his subjects and addressed them as follows: ""What folly could be greater than yours?

Presently a Lion, who had been starving for days, came along and was just about to fall upon the Ass and make a meal of him when the Cock, rising to his full height and flapping his wings vigorously, uttered a tremendous crow. Now, if there is one thing that frightens a Lion, it is the crowing of a Cock: and this one had no sooner heard the noise than he fled. The Ass was mightily elated at this, and thought that, if the Lion couldn't face a Cock, he would be still less likely to stand up to an Ass: so he ran out and pursued him.

The Wolf said he would, and told the Ass to lift up his foot, and gave his whole mind to getting out the thorn. But the Ass suddenly let out with his heels and fetched the Wolf a fearful kick in the mouth, breaking his teeth; and then he galloped off at full speed.

So he got up from his place and began dancing, but he cut such a ridiculous figure as he plunged about, and made such a grotesque exhibition of his ungainly person, that the beasts all fell upon him with ridicule and drove him away.",,0.16172478,0.2770167,0.19764383,0.30980107,0.31927916,0.31583384,0.28020427,0.29716036,0.25406882,0.32963035,sanctity.vice,0.32963035
165,THE SICK MAN AND THE DOCTOR,"A Sick Man received a visit from his Doctor, who asked him how he was. ""Fairly well, Doctor,"" said he, ""but I find I sweat a great deal."" ""Ah,"" said the Doctor, ""that's a good sign."" On his next visit he asked the same question, and his patient replied, ""I'm much as usual, but I've taken to having shivering fits, which leave me cold all over."" ""Ah,"" said the Doctor, ""that's a good sign too."" When he came the third time and inquired as before about his patient's health, the Sick Man said that he felt very feverish. ""A very good sign,"" said the Doctor; ""you are doing very nicely indeed."" Afterwards a friend came to see the invalid, and on asking him how he did, received this reply: ""My dear friend, I'm dying of good signs.""",,0.33144727,0.20241772,0.3008805,0.17742772,0.21248876,0.17737976,0.27706894,0.16482219,0.34425294,0.24594097,sanctity.virtue,0.34425294
166,THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PLANE-TREE,"Two Travellers were walking along a bare and dusty road in the heat of a summer's day. Coming presently to a Plane-tree, they joyfully turned aside to shelter from the burning rays of the sun in the deep shade of its spreading branches. As they rested, looking up into the tree, one of them remarked to his companion, ""What a useless tree the Plane is! It bears no fruit and is of no service to man at all."" The Plane-tree interrupted him with indignation. ""You ungrateful creature!"" it cried: ""you come and take shelter under me from the scorching sun, and then, in the very act of enjoying the cool shade of my foliage, you abuse me and call me good for nothing!""

167,THE FLEA AND THE OX,"A Flea once said to an Ox, ""How comes it that a big strong fellow like you is content to serve mankind, and do all their hard work for them, while I, who am no bigger than you see, live on their bodies and drink my fill of their blood, and never do a stroke for it all?"" To which the Ox replied, ""Men are very kind to me, and so I am grateful to them: they feed and house me well, and every now and then they show their fondness for me by patting me on the head and neck."" ""They'd pat me, too,"" said the Flea, ""if I let them: but I take good care they don't, or there would be nothing left of me.""",,0.44524285,0.2776481,0.34005192,0.239863,0.31403652,0.2783478,0.38206682,0.2636145,0.3766875,0.29841498,care.virtue,0.44524285
168,"THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT","The Birds were at war with the Beasts, and many battles were fought with varying success on either side. The Bat did not throw in his lot definitely with either party, but when things went well for the Birds he was found fighting in their ranks; when, on the other hand, the Beasts got the upper hand, he was to be found among the Beasts. No one paid any attention to him while the war lasted: but when it was over, and peace was restored, neither the Birds nor the Beasts would have anything to do with so double-faced a traitor, and so he remains to this day a solitary outcast from both.",,0.33164427,0.27940264,0.3438491,0.26452506,0.3606797,0.35837418,0.3000654,0.34443057,0.30202907,0.26179388,loyalty.virtue,0.3606797
169,THE MAN AND HIS TWO SWEETHEARTS,"A Man of middle age, whose hair was turning grey, had two Sweethearts, an old woman and a young one. The elder of the two didn't like having a lover who looked so much younger than herself; so, whenever he came to see her, she used to pull the dark hairs out of his head to make him look old. The younger, on the other hand, didn't like him to look so much older than herself, and took every opportunity of pulling out the grey hairs, to make him look young.

So it flew high up into the air, and then came shooting down with a great whirring of wings on to the back of a big ram. It had no sooner alighted than its claws got caught fast in the wool, and nothing it could do was of any use: there it stuck, flapping away, and only making things worse instead of better. By and by up came the Shepherd. ""Oho,"" he said, ""so that's what you'd be doing, is it?"" And he took the Jackdaw, and clipped its wings and carried it home to his children. It looked so odd that they didn't know what to make of it. ""What sort of bird is it, father?"" they asked. ""It's a Jackdaw,"" he replied, ""and nothing but a Jackdaw: but it wants to be taken for an Eagle.""

171,THE WOLF AND THE BOY,"A Wolf, who had just enjoyed a good meal and was in a playful mood, caught sight of a Boy lying flat upon the ground, and, realising that he was trying to hide, and that it was fear of himself that made him do this, he went up to him and said, ""Aha, I've found you, you see; but if you can say three things to me, the truth of which cannot be disputed, I will spare your life."" The Boy plucked up courage and thought for a moment, and then he said, ""First, it is a pity you saw me; secondly, I was a fool to let myself be seen; and thirdly, we all hate wolves because they are always making unprovoked attacks upon our flocks."" The Wolf replied, ""Well, what you say is true enough from your point of view; so you may go.""",,0.24854387,0.2259129,0.2300848,0.23175566,0.20987475,0.2545654,0.21133228,0.22503267,0.22229722,0.23372291,loyalty.vice,0.2545654
172,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","A Miller, accompanied by his young Son, was driving his Ass to market in hopes of finding a purchaser for him. On the road they met a troop of girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, ""Did you ever see such a pair of fools? To be trudging along the dusty road when they might be riding!"" The Miller thought there was sense in what they said; so he made his Son mount the Ass, and himself walked at the side. Presently they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said, ""You'll spoil that Son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along on foot! Make him walk, young lazybones! It'll do him all the good in the world."" The Miller followed their advice, and took his Son's place on the back of the Ass while the boy trudged along behind. They had not gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the Miller heard them say, ""What a selfish old man! He himself rides in comfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own legs!"" So he made his Son get up behind him. Further along the road they met some travellers, who asked the Miller whether the Ass he was riding was his own property, or a beast hired for the occasion. He replied that it was his own, and that he was taking it to market to sell. ""Good heavens!"" said they, ""with a load like that the poor beast will be so exhausted by the time he gets there that no one will look at him. Why, you'd do better to carry him!"" ""Anything to please you,"" said the old man, ""we can but try."" So they got off, tied the Ass's legs together with a rope and slung him on a pole, and at last reached the town, carrying him between them. This was so absurd a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, and chaffed the Father and Son unmercifully, some even calling them lunatics. They had then got to a bridge over the river, where the Ass, frightened by the noise and his unusual situation, kicked and struggled till he broke the ropes that bound him, and fell into the water and was drowned. Whereupon the unfortunate Miller, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that in trying to please all he had pleased none, and had lost his Ass into the bargain.",,0.34955716,0.32354715,0.32206297,0.34948993,0.40910834,0.37343594,0.3773193,0.33703148,0.34398806,0.3421706,loyalty.virtue,0.40910834
173,THE STAG AND THE VINE,"A Stag, pursued by the huntsmen, concealed himself under cover of a thick Vine. They lost track of him and passed by his hiding-place without being aware that he was anywhere near. Supposing all danger to be over, he presently began to browse on the leaves of the Vine. The movement drew the attention of the returning huntsmen, and one of them, supposing some animal to be hidden there, shot an arrow at a venture into the foliage. The unlucky Stag was pierced to the heart, and, as he expired, he said, ""I deserve my fate for my treachery in feeding upon the leaves of my protector.""

The Lion, however, when he felt the sting of the arrow, ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. A fox, who had seen it all happen, said to the Lion, ""Come, don't be a coward: why don't you stay and show fight?""

So long as the road was fairly level, the Ass got on very well: but by and by they came to a place among the hills where the road was very rough and steep, and the Ass was at his last gasp. So he begged the Mule to relieve him of a part of his load: but the Mule refused. At last, from sheer weariness, the Ass stumbled and fell down a steep place and was killed. The driver was in despair, but he did the best he could: he added the Ass's load to the Mule's, and he also flayed the Ass and put his skin on the top of the double load. The Mule could only just manage the extra weight, and, as he staggered painfully along, he said to himself, ""I have only got what I deserved: if I had been willing to help the Ass at first, I should not now be carrying his load and his skin into the bargain.""",,0.35644057,0.38329315,0.34841567,0.35416743,0.41310236,0.3401332,0.39863217,0.34810513,0.36008868,0.3866663,loyalty.virtue,0.41310236

One day, as they were playing together in their mother's chamber, they chanced upon a mirror and saw their own features for the first time. The boy saw what a handsome fellow he was, and began to boast to his Sister about his good looks: she, on her part, was ready to cry with vexation when she was aware of her plainness, and took his remarks as an insult to herself. Running to her father, she told him of her Brother's conceit, and accused him of meddling with his mother's things. He laughed and kissed them both, and said, ""My children, learn from now onwards to make a good use of the glass.

As he lay there groaning, some one passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, ""If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn't even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you've got.""",,0.25510108,0.2636401,0.2715609,0.2615392,0.27879342,0.26013055,0.30302447,0.26362255,0.3071337,0.29460335,sanctity.virtue,0.3071337

Presently the Snake came out, and the man aimed a blow at it, but only succeeded in cutting off the tip of its tail before it wriggled in again. He then tried to get it to come out a second time, pretending that he wished to make up the quarrel.

When he reached home, he put him into his stable along with the other asses. The newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable. When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again. The latter was a good deal surprised to see him back so soon, and said, ""Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?"" ""I don't want to put him through any more tests,"" replied the other: ""I could see what sort of beast he is from the companion he chose for himself.""

191,THE KID AND THE WOLF,"A Kid strayed from the flock and was chased by a Wolf. When he saw he must be caught he turned round and said to the Wolf, ""I know, sir, that I can't escape being eaten by you: and so, as my life is bound to be short, I pray you let it be as merry as may be. Will you not play me a tune to dance to before I die?"" The Wolf saw no objection to having some music before his dinner: so he took out his pipe and began to play, while the Kid danced before him. Before many minutes were passed the gods who guarded the flock heard the sound and came up to see what was going on. They no sooner clapped eyes on the Wolf than they gave chase and drove him away. As he ran off, he turned and said to the Kid, ""It's what I thoroughly deserve: my trade is the butcher's, and I had no business to turn piper to please you.""",,0.2515438,0.25305322,0.22065917,0.22778827,0.25927293,0.25426838,0.2639252,0.23913278,0.27651203,0.2443268,sanctity.virtue,0.27651203
192,THE DEBTOR AND HIS SOW,"A Man of Athens fell into debt and was pressed for the money by his creditor; but he had no means of paying at the time, so he begged for delay. But the creditor refused and said he must pay at once. Then the Debtor fetched a Sow—the only one he had—and took her to market to offer her for sale. It happened that his creditor was there too. Presently a buyer came along and asked if the Sow produced good litters. ""Yes,"" said the Debtor, ""very fine ones; and the remarkable thing is that she produces females at the Mysteries and males at the Panathenea."" (Festivals these were: and the Athenians always sacrifice a sow at one, and a boar at the other; while at the Dionysia they sacrifice a kid.) At that the creditor, who was standing by, put in, ""Don't be surprised, sir; why, still better, at the Dionysia this Sow has kids!""",,0.41320872,0.28681174,0.37711167,0.24524665,0.32248995,0.28699404,0.37577888,0.24029274,0.36910746,0.26940206,care.virtue,0.41320872
193,THE BALD HUNTSMAN,"A Man who had lost all his hair took to wearing a wig, and one day he went out hunting. It was blowing rather hard at the time, and he hadn't gone far before a gust of wind caught his hat and carried it off, and his wig too, much to the amusement of the hunt. But he quite entered into the joke, and said, ""Ah, well! the hair that wig is made of didn't stick to the head on which it grew; so it's no wonder it won't stick to mine.""",,0.2901226,0.33127016,0.28030705,0.36222303,0.29229364,0.34457886,0.30132622,0.2971155,0.34412658,0.36149108,fairness.vice,0.36222303

He went at once to look for him, but, meeting with no success in his search, he made a vow that, if he should discover the thief, he would sacrifice a calf to Jupiter. Continuing his search, he entered a thicket, where he presently espied a lion devouring the lost Bull. Terrified with fear, he raised his hands to heaven and cried, ""Great Jupiter, I vowed I would sacrifice a calf to thee if I should discover the thief: but now a full-grown Bull I promise thee if only I myself escape unhurt from his clutches.""",,0.32905048,0.18657406,0.2271844,0.15124328,0.22975817,0.19153933,0.25368443,0.12120176,0.24783452,0.16345881,care.virtue,0.32905048

But very soon afterwards he was put into the harness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy load behind him. At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual exertions, he said dejectedly to himself, ""I must have been mistaken about my father; he can only have been an ass after all.""",,0.28796217,0.29325077,0.27832076,0.34617925,0.32019815,0.33791047,0.35941845,0.35177144,0.33563015,0.35454977,authority.virtue,0.35941845

Presently the lion perceived that he was being pursued; so, stopping short, he rounded on his pursuer and gave a loud roar. The Hound immediately turned tail and fled.

After a time he thought he would go and see how they were getting on; and first he went to the gardener's wife. He asked her how she was, and how things were going with herself and her husband. She replied that on the whole they were doing very well: ""But,"" she continued, ""I do wish we could have some good heavy rain: the garden wants it badly."" Then he went on to the potter's wife and made the same inquiries of her. She replied that she and her husband had nothing to complain of: ""But,"" she went on, ""I do wish we could have some nice dry weather, to dry the pottery."" Her Father looked at her with a humorous expression on his face. ""You want dry weather,"" he said, ""and your sister wants rain","I was going to ask in my prayers that your wishes should be granted; but now it strikes me I had better not refer to the subject.""",0.20211537,0.05109468,0.18694519,0.055674694,0.13991797,0.076145716,0.16647792,0.066612035,0.19435035,0.06892843,care.virtue,0.20211537
198,THE THIEF AND THE INNKEEPER,"A Thief hired a room at an inn, and stayed there some days on the look-out for something to steal. No opportunity, however, presented itself, till one day, when there was a festival to be celebrated, the Innkeeper appeared in a fine new coat and sat down before the door of the inn for an airing. The Thief no sooner set eyes upon the coat than he longed to get possession of it. There was no business doing, so he went and took a seat by the side of the Innkeeper, and began talking to him. They conversed together for some time, and then the Thief suddenly yawned and howled like a wolf. The Innkeeper asked him in some concern what ailed him. The Thief replied, ""I will tell you about myself, sir, but first I must beg you to take charge of my clothes for me, for I intend to leave them with you. Why I have these fits of yawning I cannot tell: maybe they are sent as a punishment for my misdeeds; but, whatever the reason, the facts are that when I have yawned three times I become a ravening wolf and fly at men's throats."" As he finished speaking he yawned a second time and howled again as before. The Innkeeper, believing every word he said, and terrified at the prospect of being confronted with a wolf, got up hastily and started to run indoors; but the Thief caught him by the coat and tried to stop him, crying, ""Stay, sir, stay, and take charge of my clothes, or else I shall never see them again."" As he spoke he opened his mouth and began to yawn for the third time. The Innkeeper, mad with the fear of being eaten by a wolf, slipped out of his coat, which remained in the other's hands, and bolted into the inn and locked the door behind him; and the Thief then quietly stole off with his spoil.",,0.27005216,0.27284148,0.22049019,0.26800558,0.2506387,0.30448344,0.27778596,0.2631939,0.29284427,0.2604584,loyalty.vice,0.30448344
199,THE PACK-ASS AND THE WILD ASS,"A Wild Ass, who was wandering idly about, one day came upon a Pack-Ass lying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself. Going up to him, he said, ""What a lucky beast you are! Your sleek coat shows how well you live: how I envy you!"" Not long after the Wild Ass saw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy load, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick stick.

200,THE ASS AND HIS MASTERS,"A Gardener had an Ass which had a very hard time of it, what with scanty food, heavy loads, and constant beating. The Ass therefore begged Jupiter to take him away from the Gardener and hand him over to another master. So Jupiter sent Mercury to the Gardener to bid him sell the Ass to a Potter, which he did. But the Ass was as discontented as ever, for he had to work harder than before: so he begged Jupiter for relief a second time, and Jupiter very obligingly arranged that he should be sold to a Tanner. But when the Ass saw what his new master's trade was, he cried in despair, ""Why wasn't I content to serve either of my former masters, hard as I had to work and badly as I was treated? for they would have buried me decently, but now I shall come in the end to the tanning-vat.""

I am free as the air, and never do a stroke of work; and, as for fodder, I have only to go to the hills and there I find far more than enough for my needs. But you! you depend on your master for food, and he makes you carry heavy loads every day and beats you unmercifully."" At that moment a Lion appeared on the scene, and made no attempt to molest the Pack-Ass owing to the presence of the driver; but he fell upon the Wild Ass, who had no one to protect him, and without more ado made a meal of him.

But, not content with the results of their own work, they were always casting longing eyes upon the crops and fruits of their neighbours, which they stole, whenever they got the chance, and added to their own store. At last their covetousness made Jupiter so angry that he changed them into Ants.

But one hot summer the marsh dried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for frogs like damp places if they can get them. By and by they came to a deep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other, ""This looks a nice cool place: let us jump in and settle here.""

Standing below in full view of her, he praised her song in the most flattering terms, and begged her to descend, saying he would like to make the acquaintance of the owner of so beautiful a voice. But she was not to be taken in, and replied, ""You are very much mistaken, my dear sir, if you imagine I am going to come down: I keep well out of the way of you and your kind ever since the day when I saw numbers of grasshoppers' wings strewn about the entrance to a fox's earth.""",,0.34235463,0.33095866,0.3071858,0.3624137,0.32757324,0.33969796,0.35490224,0.33564556,0.3596416,0.3561646,fairness.vice,0.3624137

Along with him went his Boy, carrying a sling: and whenever the Farmer asked for the sling the starlings understood what he said and warned the Rooks and they were off in a moment. So the Farmer hit on a trick. ""My lad,"" said he, ""we must get the better of these birds somehow. After this, when I want the sling, I won't say 'sling,' but just 'humph!' and you must then hand me the sling quickly."" Presently back came the whole flock. ""Humph!"" said the Farmer; but the starlings took no notice, and he had time to sling several stones among them, hitting one on the head, another in the legs, and another in the wing, before they got out of range. As they made all haste away they met some cranes, who asked them what the matter was. ""Matter?"" said one of the Rooks; ""it's those rascals, men, that are the matter. Don't you go near them.

207,THE ASS AND THE DOG,"An Ass and a Dog were on their travels together, and, as they went along, they found a sealed packet lying on the ground. The Ass picked it up, broke the seal, and found it contained some writing, which he proceeded to read out aloud to the Dog. As he read on it turned out to be all about grass and barley and hay—in short, all the kinds of fodder that Asses are fond of. The Dog was a good deal bored with listening to all this, till at last his impatience got the better of him, and he cried, ""Just skip a few pages, friend, and see if there isn't something about meat and bones."" The Ass glanced all through the packet, but found nothing of the sort, and said so.

As they went along the road all the people they met uncovered and bowed their heads out of reverence for the Image; but the Ass thought they were doing it out of respect for himself, and began to give himself airs accordingly. At last he became so conceited that he imagined he could do as he liked, and, by way of protest against the load he was carrying, he came to a full stop and flatly declined to proceed any further. His driver, finding him so obstinate, hit him hard and long with his stick, saying the while, ""Oh, you dunder-headed idiot, do you suppose it's come to this, that men pay worship to an Ass?""

209,THE ATHENIAN AND THE THEBAN,"An Athenian and a Theban were on the road together, and passed the time in conversation, as is the way of travellers. After discussing a variety of subjects they began to talk about heroes, a topic that tends to be more fertile than edifying. Each of them was lavish in his praises of the heroes of his own city, until eventually the Theban asserted that Hercules was the greatest hero who had ever lived on earth, and now occupied a foremost place among the gods; while the Athenian insisted that Theseus was far superior, for his fortune had been in every way supremely blessed, whereas Hercules had at one time been forced to act as a servant. And he gained his point, for he was a very glib fellow, like all Athenians; so that the Theban, who was no match for him in talking, cried at last in some disgust, ""All right, have your way; I only hope that, when our heroes are angry with us, Athens may suffer from the anger of Hercules, and Thebes only from that of Theseus.""",,0.3403152,0.30488205,0.33531004,0.24287677,0.35419682,0.34713447,0.35632807,0.32791123,0.35627994,0.2456034,authority.virtue,0.35632807

""Your conduct,"" said they, ""is very strange and, we think, very unfair. We provide you with wool and lambs and milk and you give us nothing but grass, and even that we have to find for ourselves: but you get nothing at all from the Dog, and yet you feed him with tit-bits from your own table."" Their remarks were overheard by the Dog, who spoke up at once and said, ""Yes, and quite right, too: where would you be if it wasn't for me? Thieves would steal you! Wolves would eat you! Indeed, if I didn't keep constant watch over you, you would be too terrified even to graze!""

212,THE SHEPHERD AND THE WOLF,"A Shepherd found a Wolf's Cub straying in the pastures, and took him home and reared him along with his dogs. When the Cub grew to his full size, if ever a wolf stole a sheep from the flock, he used to join the dogs in hunting him down. It sometimes happened that the dogs failed to come up with the thief, and, abandoning the pursuit, returned home. The Wolf would on such occasions continue the chase by himself, and when he overtook the culprit, would stop and share the feast with him, and then return to the Shepherd. But if some time passed without a sheep being carried off by the wolves, he would steal one himself and share his plunder with the dogs. The Shepherd's suspicions were aroused, and one day he caught him in the act; and, fastening a rope round his neck, hung him on the nearest tree.

213,"THE LION, JUPITER, AND THE ELEPHANT","The Lion, for all his size and strength, and his sharp teeth and claws, is a coward in one thing: he can't bear the sound of a cock crowing, and runs away whenever he hears it. He complained bitterly to Jupiter for making him like that; but Jupiter said it wasn't his fault: he had done the best he could for him, and, considering this was his only failing, he ought to be well content. The Lion, however, wouldn't be comforted, and was so ashamed of his timidity that he wished he might die. In this state of mind, he met the Elephant and had a talk with him. He noticed that the great beast cocked up his ears all the time, as if he were listening for something, and he asked him why he did so. Just then a gnat came humming by, and the Elephant said, ""Do you see that wretched little buzzing insect? I'm terribly afraid of its getting into my ear: if it once gets in, I'm dead and done for."" The Lion's spirits rose at once when he heard this: ""For,"" he said to himself, ""if the Elephant, huge as he is, is afraid of a gnat, I needn't be so much ashamed of being afraid of a cock, who is ten thousand times bigger than a gnat.""",,0.35784584,0.38639984,0.35377908,0.3117197,0.34293354,0.3328954,0.37534392,0.3322338,0.37383673,0.375254,care.vice,0.38639984

Failing to get the Dog out by means of these, the Gardener went down into the well himself in order to fetch him up. But the Dog thought he had come to make sure of drowning him; so he bit his master as soon as he came within reach, and hurt him a good deal, with the result that he left the Dog to his fate and climbed out of the well, remarking, ""It serves me quite right for trying to save so determined a suicide.""",,0.2542035,0.28233358,0.23898487,0.2976133,0.24857956,0.2769495,0.31939405,0.24160866,0.28174818,0.31180865,authority.virtue,0.31939405

He went to the Lion and said, ""I think you will make a very good husband for my daughter: but I cannot consent to your union unless you let me draw your teeth and pare your nails, for my daughter is terribly afraid of them.""

By and by a great storm came on, and their boat with all the cargo went to the bottom, but the three travellers managed to reach land. Ever since then the Seagull flies to and fro over the sea, and every now and then dives below the surface, looking for the lead he's lost; while the Bat is so afraid of meeting his creditors that he hides away by day and only comes out at night to feed; and the Bramble catches hold of the clothes of every one who passes by, hoping some day to recognise and recover the lost garments.

Some time afterwards he came to the farmyard again, and found the Dog lying out of reach on the stable roof. ""Come down,"" he called, ""and be eaten: you remember our agreement?""

Presently she espied a Beetle, and begged it to aid her. So when the Eagle came up the Beetle warned her not to touch the hare, which was under its protection. But the Eagle never noticed the Beetle because it was so small, seized the hare and ate her up. The Beetle never forgot this, and used to keep an eye on the Eagle's nest, and whenever the Eagle laid an egg it climbed up and rolled it out of the nest and broke it. At last the Eagle got so worried over the loss of her eggs that she went up to Jupiter, who is the special protector of Eagles, and begged him to give her a safe place to nest in: so he let her lay her eggs in his lap. But the Beetle noticed this and made a ball of dirt the size of an Eagle's egg, and flew up and deposited it in Jupiter's lap. When Jupiter saw the dirt, he stood up to shake it out of his robe, and, forgetting about the eggs, he shook them out too, and they were broken just as before. Ever since then, they say, Eagles never lay their eggs at the season when Beetles are about.

The Lark examined the nets with great curiosity, and presently, catching sight of the bait, hopped on to them in order to secure it, and became entangled in the meshes.

All on board were thrown into the water, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the Monkey among the rest. A Dolphin saw him, and, supposing him to be a man, took him on his back and began swimming towards the shore. When they got near the Piraeus, which is the port of Athens, the Dolphin asked the Monkey if he was an Athenian. The Monkey replied that he was, and added that he came of a very distinguished family. ""Then, of course, you know the Piraeus,"" continued the Dolphin. The Monkey thought he was referring to some high official or other, and replied, ""Oh, yes, he's a very old friend of mine.""

When the storm abated, and they were about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in the following way. They divided the life of Man among them, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which were peculiarly his own. The Horse took youth, and hence young men are high-mettled and impatient of restraint; the Ox took middle age, and accordingly men in middle life are steady and hard-working; while the Dog took old age, which is the reason why old men are so often peevish and ill-tempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to their comfort, while they are disposed to snap at those who are unfamiliar or distasteful to them.",,0.36125863,0.17678468,0.22454122,0.11622713,0.2719724,0.18943092,0.2863856,0.1402,0.2728141,0.17096055,care.virtue,0.36125863

244,THE IMPOSTOR,"A certain man fell ill, and, being in a very bad way, he made a vow that he would sacrifice a hundred oxen to the gods if they would grant him a return to health. Wishing to see how he would keep his vow, they caused him to recover in a short time. Now, he hadn't an ox in the world, so he made a hundred little oxen out of tallow and offered them up on an altar, at the same time saying, ""Ye gods, I call you to witness that I have discharged my vow."" The gods determined to be even with him, so they sent him a dream, in which he was bidden to go to the sea-shore and fetch a hundred crowns which he was to find there. Hastening in great excitement to the shore, he fell in with a band of robbers, who seized him and carried him off to sell as a slave: and when they sold him a hundred crowns was the sum he fetched.

The Ass divided it all into three equal parts, and modestly begged the others to take their choice; at which the Lion, bursting with fury, sprang upon the Ass and tore him to pieces. Then, glaring at the Fox, he bade him make a fresh division. The Fox gathered almost the whole in one great heap for the Lion's share, leaving only the smallest possible morsel for himself. ""My dear friend,"" said the Lion, ""how did you get the knack of it so well?"" The Fox replied, ""Me? Oh, I took a lesson from the Ass.""

247,"THE FOWLER, THE PARTRIDGE, AND THE COCK","One day, as a Fowler was sitting down to a scanty supper of herbs and bread, a friend dropped in unexpectedly. The larder was empty; so he went out and caught a tame Partridge, which he kept as a decoy, and was about to wring her neck when she cried, ""Surely you won't kill me? Why, what will you do without me next time you go fowling? How will you get the birds to come to your nets?"" He let her go at this, and went to his hen-house, where he had a plump young Cock. When the Cock saw what he was after, he too pleaded for his life, and said, ""If you kill me, how will you know the time of night? and who will wake you up in the morning when it is time to get to work?"" The Fowler, however, replied, ""You are useful for telling the time, I know; but, for all that, I can't send my friend supperless to bed.""

What does your strength amount to after all? That you can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth—just like a woman in a temper—and nothing more. But I'm stronger than you: if you don't believe it, let us fight and see."" So saying, the Gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the Lion on the nose. When the Lion felt the sting, in his haste to crush him he scratched his nose badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its victory. Presently, however, it got entangled in a spider's web, and was caught and eaten by the spider, thus falling a prey to an insignificant insect after having triumphed over the King of the Beasts.",,0.32758388,0.38950735,0.31372762,0.31377304,0.35417262,0.32279888,0.37191972,0.34963328,0.37991056,0.34988394,care.vice,0.38950735

So he first killed his sheep and used them for food; then, as the storm still continued, he killed his goats; and, last of all, as the weather showed no signs of improving, he was compelled to kill his oxen and eat them.

250,THE EAGLE AND THE FOX,"An Eagle and a Fox became great friends and determined to live near one another: they thought that the more they saw of each other the better friends they would be. So the Eagle built a nest at the top of a high tree, while the Fox settled in a thicket at the foot of it and produced a litter of cubs. One day the Fox went out foraging for food, and the Eagle, who also wanted food for her young, flew down into the thicket, caught up the Fox's cubs, and carried them up into the tree for a meal for herself and her family. When the Fox came back, and found out what had happened, she was not so much sorry for the loss of her cubs as furious because she couldn't get at the Eagle and pay her out for her treachery. So she sat down not far off and cursed her. But it wasn't long before she had her revenge. Some villagers happened to be sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar, and the Eagle flew down and carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest. There was a strong wind blowing, and the nest caught fire, with the result that her fledglings fell half-roasted to the ground. Then the Fox ran to the spot and devoured them in full sight of the Eagle.

When the Butcher turned round, he missed the meat at once, and charged them with having stolen it: but the one who had taken it said he hadn't got it, and the one who had got it said he hadn't taken it.

To his astonishment, instead of being crushed it doubled in size; and, on his attacking it again and smiting it with his club, it swelled up to an enormous size and blocked up the whole road. Upon this he dropped his club, and stood looking at it in amazement. Just then Minerva appeared, and said to him, ""Leave it alone, my friend; that which you see before you is the apple of discord: if you do not meddle with it, it remains small as it was at first, but if you resort to violence it swells into the thing you see.""",,0.37598312,0.3235055,0.37440154,0.34056202,0.37221855,0.33849362,0.40324548,0.37156168,0.39704406,0.38107416,authority.virtue,0.40324548
253,THE FOX WHO SERVED A LION,"A Lion had a Fox to attend on him, and whenever they went hunting the Fox found the prey and the Lion fell upon it and killed it, and then they divided it between them in certain proportions. But the Lion always got a very large share, and the Fox a very small one, which didn't please the latter at all; so he determined to set up on his own account. He began by trying to steal a lamb from a flock of sheep: but the shepherd saw him and set his dogs on him.

He consulted a number of doctors from time to time, and they all, with one exception, told him that his life was in no immediate danger, but that his illness would probably last a considerable time. The one who took a different view of his case, who was also the last to be consulted, bade him prepare for the worst: ""You have not twenty-four hours to live,"" said he, ""and I fear I can do nothing."" As it turned out, however, he was quite wrong; for at the end of a few days the sick man quitted his bed and took a walk abroad, looking, it is true, as pale as a ghost. In the course of his walk he met the Doctor who had prophesied his death. ""Dear me,"" said the latter, ""how do you do? You are fresh from the other world, no doubt. Pray, how are our departed friends getting on there?"" ""Most comfortably,"" replied the other, ""for they have drunk the water of oblivion, and have forgotten all the troubles of life. By the way, just before I left, the authorities were making arrangements to prosecute all the doctors, because they won't let sick men die in the course of nature, but use their arts to keep them alive.

The Wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the Fox, so he called the attention of the Lion to his absence, and said, ""You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the Fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill."" Just then the Fox came in and heard the last words of the Wolf. The Lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, ""Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness."" ""And may I ask if you have found one?"" said the Lion. ""I have, sire,"" said the Fox, ""and it is this: you must flay a Wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm."" The Lion accordingly turned to the Wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the Fox's prescription; but the Fox laughed and said to himself, ""That's what comes of stirring up ill-will.""",,0.33393326,0.27917585,0.31400448,0.25819927,0.29107133,0.27395737,0.28565753,0.27187145,0.30147228,0.29212183,care.virtue,0.33393326

Jupiter was surprised at this conduct on his part, and asked why, after having been so cordial with all the other gods, he had behaved like that to Plutus.

As he lay there unable to move, a swarm of horseflies settled on him and sucked his blood undisturbed, for he was too weak even to shake them off. A Hedgehog saw him, and asked if he should brush away the flies that were tormenting him; but the Fox replied, ""Oh, please, no, not on any account, for these flies have sucked their fill and are taking very little from me now; but, if you drive them off, another swarm of hungry ones will come and suck all the blood I have left, and leave me without a drop in my veins.""",,0.24115545,0.22774449,0.2224736,0.23431852,0.2254495,0.22465926,0.22856425,0.22959259,0.23082584,0.2746182,sanctity.vice,0.2746182

She was very anxious to get the same sort of reputation herself; and, one day, seeing some travellers approaching, she flew on to a branch of a tree at the roadside and cawed as loud as she could. The travellers were in some dismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen; till one of them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, ""It's all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it's only a crow and that means nothing.""

The words were scarcely out of his mouth when, much to his dismay, Death stood before him and professed his readiness to serve him.

One of his men noticed his frequent visits to the spot, and one day watched him and discovered his secret. Waiting his opportunity, he went one night and dug up the gold and stole it. Next day the Miser visited the place as usual, and, finding his treasure gone, fell to tearing his hair and groaning over his loss. In this condition he was seen by one of his neighbours, who asked him what his trouble was. The Miser told him of his misfortune; but the other replied, ""Don't take it so much to heart, my friend; put a brick into the hole, and take a look at it every day: you won't be any worse off than before, for even when you had your gold it was of no earthly use to you.""",,0.328807,0.35987112,0.35618865,0.37700337,0.34535316,0.3890717,0.34645012,0.34474134,0.35823008,0.37439254,loyalty.vice,0.3890717

At last one of them, to shame the rest, and show how brave he was, said, ""I am not a bit frightened! See, I'll step right into the water!"" He had no sooner done so than the current swept him off his feet. When the others saw him being carried down-stream they cried, ""Don't go and leave us!

But one day a Stag came into the meadow, and said he had as good a right to feed there as the Horse, and moreover chose all the best places for himself. The Horse, wishing to be revenged upon his unwelcome visitor, went to a man and asked if he would help him to turn out the Stag. ""Yes,"" said the man, ""I will by all means; but I can only do so if you let me put a bridle in your mouth and mount on your back.""

267,"THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE STAG","A Lion lay sick in his den, unable to provide himself with food. So he said to his friend the Fox, who came to ask how he did, ""My good friend, I wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big Stag, who lives there, to come to my den: I have a fancy to make my dinner off a stag's heart and brains."" The Fox went to the wood and found the Stag and said to him, ""My dear sir, you're in luck. You know the Lion, our King: well, he's at the point of death, and has appointed you his successor to rule over the beasts. I hope you won't forget that I was the first to bring you the good news. And now I must be going back to him; and, if you take my advice, you'll come too and be with him at the last."" The Stag was highly flattered, and followed the Fox to the Lion's den, suspecting nothing. No sooner had he got inside than the Lion sprang upon him, but he misjudged his spring, and the Stag got away with only his ears torn, and returned as fast as he could to the shelter of the wood. The Fox was much mortified, and the Lion, too, was dreadfully disappointed, for he was getting very hungry in spite of his illness. So he begged the Fox to have another try at coaxing the Stag to his den. ""It'll be almost impossible this time,"" said the Fox, ""but I'll try""; and off he went to the wood a second time, and found the Stag resting and trying to recover from his fright. As soon as he saw the Fox he cried, ""You scoundrel, what do you mean by trying to lure me to my death like that? Take yourself off, or I'll do you to death with my horns."" But the Fox was entirely shameless. ""What a coward you were,"" said he; ""surely you didn't think the Lion meant any harm? Why, he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your ear when you went off like a scared rabbit. You have rather disgusted him, and I'm not sure he won't make the wolf King instead, unless you come back at once and show you've got some spirit. I promise you he won't hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant."" The Stag was foolish enough to be persuaded to return, and this time the Lion made no mistake, but overpowered him, and feasted right royally upon his carcase. The Fox, meanwhile, watched his chance and, when the Lion wasn't looking, filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble. Presently the Lion began searching for them, of course without success: and the Fox, who was watching him, said, ""I don't think it's much use your looking for the brains: a creature who twice walked into a Lion's den can't have got any.""",,0.32113096,0.31140742,0.29949674,0.27227318,0.3000031,0.30832544,0.31421834,0.27132273,0.3127811,0.30545047,care.virtue,0.32113096
268,THE MAN WHO LOST HIS SPADE,"A Man was engaged in digging over his vineyard, and one day on coming to work he missed his Spade. Thinking it may have been stolen by one of his labourers, he questioned them closely, but they one and all denied any knowledge of it. He was not convinced by their denials, and insisted that they should all go to the town and take oath in a temple that they were not guilty of the theft. This was because he had no great opinion of the simple country deities, but thought that the thief would not pass undetected by the shrewder gods of the town. When they got inside the gates the first thing they heard was the town crier proclaiming a reward for information about a thief who had stolen something from the city temple. ""Well,"" said the Man to himself, ""it strikes me I had better go back home again. If these town gods can't detect the thieves who steal from their own temples, it's scarcely likely they can tell me who stole my Spade.""",,0.32777652,0.30631876,0.33047044,0.32243085,0.3449631,0.3553484,0.35264936,0.33536658,0.38581595,0.29508862,sanctity.virtue,0.38581595
269,THE PARTRIDGE AND THE FOWLER,"A Fowler caught a Partridge in his nets, and was just about to wring its neck when it made a piteous appeal to him to spare its life and said, ""Do not kill me, but let me live and I will repay you for your kindness by decoying other partridges into your nets."" ""No,"" said the Fowler, ""I will not spare you.

270,THE RUNAWAY SLAVE,"A Slave, being discontented with his lot, ran away from his master. He was soon missed by the latter, who lost no time in mounting his horse and setting out in pursuit of the fugitive.

271,THE HUNTER AND THE WOODMAN,"A Hunter was searching in the forest for the tracks of a lion, and, catching sight presently of a Woodman engaged in felling a tree, he went up to him and asked him if he had noticed a lion's footprints anywhere about, or if he knew where his den was. The Woodman answered, ""If you will come with me, I will show you the lion himself."" The Hunter turned pale with fear, and his teeth chattered as he replied, ""Oh, I'm not looking for the lion, thanks, but only for his tracks.""",,0.3246306,0.24092807,0.29589722,0.16061895,0.22998506,0.2208719,0.27069098,0.16766204,0.2879266,0.17204405,care.virtue,0.3246306
272,THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE,"An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two. A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the Eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.

273,THE ROGUE AND THE ORACLE,"A Rogue laid a wager that he would prove the Oracle at Delphi to be untrustworthy by procuring from it a false reply to an inquiry by himself. So he went to the temple on the appointed day with a small bird in his hand, which he concealed under the folds of his cloak, and asked whether what he held in his hand were alive or dead. If the Oracle said ""dead,"" he meant to produce the bird alive: if the reply was ""alive,"" he intended to wring its neck and show it to be dead. But the Oracle was one too many for him, for the answer he got was this: ""Stranger, whether the thing that you hold in your hand be alive or dead is a matter that depends entirely on your own will.""",,0.37259975,0.34641886,0.457148,0.43746778,0.37460133,0.45976588,0.44660056,0.45444617,0.44018343,0.39177272,loyalty.vice,0.45976588

As the Ass with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him pass, the Horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist kicking him to make him move faster. The Ass held his peace, but did not forget the other's insolence. Not long afterwards the Horse became broken-winded, and was sold by his owner to a farmer. One day, as he was drawing a dung-cart, he met the Ass again, who in turn derided him and said, ""Aha! you never thought to come to this, did you, you who were so proud!

275,THE DOG CHASING A WOLF,"A Dog was chasing a Wolf, and as he ran he thought what a fine fellow he was, and what strong legs he had, and how quickly they covered the ground. ""Now, there's this Wolf,"" he said to himself, ""what a poor creature he is: he's no match for me, and he knows it and so he runs away."" But the Wolf looked round just then and said, ""Don't you imagine I'm running away from you, my friend: it's your master I'm afraid of.""",,0.14345911,0.15310362,0.14715296,0.17274472,0.16894172,0.19882447,0.19707145,0.17560247,0.15070556,0.16125302,loyalty.vice,0.19882447
276,GRIEF AND HIS DUE,"When Jupiter was assigning the various gods their privileges, it so happened that Grief was not present with the rest: but when all had received their share, he too entered and claimed his due. Jupiter was at a loss to know what to do, for there was nothing left for him. However, at last he decided that to him should belong the tears that are shed for the dead. Thus it is the same with Grief as it is with the other gods. The more devoutly men render to him his due, the more lavish is he of that which he has to bestow. It is not well, therefore, to mourn long for the departed; else Grief, whose sole pleasure is in such mourning, will be quick to send fresh cause for tears.",,0.4809766,0.35239074,0.45354643,0.3070657,0.40491205,0.3759088,0.45518923,0.33878252,0.47700417,0.332302,care.virtue,0.4809766

278,THE WOMAN AND THE FARMER,"A Woman, who had lately lost her husband, used to go every day to his grave and lament her loss. A Farmer, who was engaged in ploughing not far from the spot, set eyes upon the Woman and desired to have her for his wife: so he left his plough and came and sat by her side, and began to shed tears himself. She asked him why he wept; and he replied, ""I have lately lost my wife, who was very dear to me, and tears ease my grief."" ""And I,"" said she, ""have lost my husband."" And so for a while they mourned in silence. Then he said, ""Since you and I are in like case, shall we not do well to marry and live together? I shall take the place of your dead husband, and you, that of my dead wife."" The Woman consented to the plan, which indeed seemed reasonable enough: and they dried their tears. Meanwhile, a thief had come and stolen the oxen which the Farmer had left with his plough. On discovering the theft, he beat his breast and loudly bewailed his loss. When the Woman heard his cries, she came and said, ""Why, are you weeping still?"" To which he replied, ""Yes, and I mean it this time.""",,0.3544212,0.27233225,0.30569407,0.1868551,0.2662069,0.2442389,0.29199773,0.2127508,0.32420006,0.23968914,care.virtue,0.3544212

The Hunter readily agreed; but the Horseman had no sooner got the hare in his hands than he set spurs to his horse and went off at full gallop. The Hunter ran after him for some little distance; but it soon dawned upon him that he had been tricked, and he gave up trying to overtake the Horseman, and, to save his face, called after him as loud as he could, ""All right, sir, all right, take your hare: it was meant all along as a present.""",,0.34367505,0.31949276,0.31715077,0.31599087,0.36699328,0.3337996,0.3645029,0.21783976,0.3153199,0.283506,loyalty.virtue,0.36699328

At the end of the day he drove them home and put them all into the pen together. Next day the weather was so bad that he could not take them out as usual: so he kept them at home in the pen, and fed them there. He only gave his own goats enough food to keep them from starving, but he gave the Wild Goats as much as they could eat and more; for he was very anxious for them to stay, and he thought that if he fed them well they wouldn't want to leave him. When the weather improved, he took them all out to pasture again; but no sooner had they got near the hills than the Wild Goats broke away from the flock and scampered off. The Goatherd was very much disgusted at this, and roundly abused them for their ingratitude. ""Rascals!"" he cried, ""to run away like that after the way I've treated you!"" Hearing this, one of them turned round and said, ""Oh, yes, you treated us all right—too well, in fact; it was just that that put us on our guard. If you treat newcomers like ourselves so much better than your own flock, it's more than likely that, if another lot of strange goats joined yours, _we_ should then be neglected in favour of the last comers.""",,0.2466435,0.23292926,0.19602023,0.19646394,0.29403403,0.24192953,0.26498073,0.22061452,0.24052092,0.23488452,loyalty.virtue,0.29403403
